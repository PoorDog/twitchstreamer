twitchstreamer
==============

a wrapper script for [livestreamer](http://livestreamer.tanuki.se), so you don't have to go to twitch.tv every time just to look at what streams are actually online.

to-do:
- implement a "favorites" setting
- sanitize some of the twitch statuses (eg remove the \n characters, etc)
